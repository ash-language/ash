Variables can be declared with only "var" keyword.

```
var variable = "value"
```

Declaration without definition is possible.

```
var variable
```

If the variable is wanted to be constant, "const" keyword can be used. Constant variables can not be redefined and redeclared.

```
const var variable = "value"
```

Properities/elements of a contant object/array can be changed.
